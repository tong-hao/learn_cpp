1: RODRICK: (WHISPERING) Greg?    2: GREG: (GROGGILY) Mmm.    3: - (IN SINGSONG) Greg? - What?    4: - Greg! - Huh? What?    5: What are you doing? Get up!
6: Mom and Dad have been calling you for an hour.    7: You're about to be late for your first day of middle school.
8: What?    9: Oh, geez! How did that happen?    10: Go, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!    11: She sent me to get you while she waits in the car!
12: (EX CLAIMS)    13: What are you doing? What's going on?    14: Getting ready for...    15: (HOOTING)    16: ...school.    17: Are you insane? School doesn't start till next week.
18: And, FYI, school doesn't start at 4:00 in the morning!    19: You woke up Manny. And if he doesn't go back down...
20: Good morning!    21: There is no way he is going back down.    22: I just wanted to sleep till 6:00.    23: - Bubby! - FRANK: Go to bed. I got him.
24: Greg, what are you doing up making all this noise?    25: It was Rodrick! He woke me up!    26: He changed my clock!    27: (SNORING)
28: - But I swear, he was just... - Go to bed.    29: What is that smell? I can't even identify it.    30: Bubby!    31: (GRUNTS)    32: (GIGGLING)
33: KIDS: Happy Birthday!    34: Here, Bubby.    35: GREG: Wow! Look at the size of that flamethrower!    36: Okay, first of all, let me get something straight.
37: This is a journal, not a diary.    38: Yeah, I know what it says on the cover.    39: But when my mom went out to buy this thing,
40: I specifically told her not to buy one that said "diary" on it.    41: This just proves Mom doesn't understand anything about kids my age.
42: - GREG: Huh? - Sissy!    43: The only reason I agreed to write in this thing is because    44: when I'm rich and famous I'll have better things to do
45: than answer people's stupid questions all day long.    46: Gregory, tell us about your childhood!    47: Were you always so smart and handsome?
48: Here's my journal. Now, shoo, shoo.    49: SUSAN: That's our boy up there.    50: Why did I ever say no to him?    51: Mom got me this thing
52: so I could write down my feelings about starting middle school.    53: But I'm gonna be fine.    54: It's my best friend, Rowley Jefferson, I'm worried about.
55: He's definitely not middle school ready.    56: Geronimo!    57: (WHOOPS)    58: He's not quite clear on the concept of growing up.
59: I want a puppy, a kitty, a gumball machine...    60: But anyway, this is about me, not Rowley.    61: I always figured they'd make a movie about my life.
62: But I didn't think they'd start the story here.    63: Because, seriously, who wants to see a movie about a kid
64: who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?    65: (ALARM BUZZING)    66: (GROANS)    67: (RODRICK EX CLAIMING)    68: Three days, no shower. Smell the love!
69: Let me go, Rodrick!    70: (GROANS)    71: Come on. We're just having some fun, right?    72: No, okay. So, look.    73: Mom asked me to give you some advice about middle school.
74: It's real simple.    75: Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. Don't go anywhere.    76: Don't sit down. Don't raise your hand. Don't go to the bathroom.
77: Don't get noticed. Don't choose the wrong locker. Don't...    78: Who am I kidding?    79: You'll be dead or homeschooled by the end of the year, anyway.
80: And don't be seen with Rowley.    81: (EX CLAIMING)    82: Manny, stop it! Mom!    83: RODRICK: Thanks for the eggs, Mom.    84: - Frank? - Greg?
85: I think it's gross and undignified    86: that I have to eat breakfast next to him on the potty.    87: Okay, well, it's your fault he's still potty training.
88: Don't look down, Manny.    89: The potty monster doesn't like it when you look at him.    90: (SCREAMS)    91: I was just joking with him.
92: Okay. Kiss him you're sorry and then let's get a move on.    93: Can't be late for your first day of school.    94: (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
95: GREG: Let me just say for the record that I think middle school may be    96: the dumbest idea ever invented.    97: You got kids like me who haven't hit their growth spurt yet
98: mixed in with gorillas who have to shave twice a day.    99: There's juvenile delinquents and weirdos.    100: I'm smaller than about 95% of the kids at my school...
101: CHIRAG: Give it back! Stop!    102: ...so thank God for Chirag Gupta.    103: - It's mine! Stop! - Can I have the backpack?
104: - You got to jump higher. - CHIRAG: It's not yours!    105: He's an excellent buffer between me and these morons.
106: Hey, Greg.    107: Hey, fella!    108: Seriously, I don't know what happened to these kids over the summer.    109: Was there a nuclear accident?
110: Science experiment gone bad?    111: Thank God there are a few normal people or this place would be a total freak show.
112: If you're as discriminating as I am,    113: it can be tough to figure out where to sit on your first day of middle school.
114: One bad move    115: and you're stuck next to some idiot for the rest of the year.    116: (SNIFFLING)    117: ROWLEY: Greg!    118: Remember how I said Rowley wasn't middle school ready?
119: Well, there you go.    120: (SPEAKING SPANISH)    121: What are you wearing?    122: My family just got back from Guatemala! It's my serape!
123: Nice, huh?    124: All right, class, I'm Mrs. Flint. Everybody take your seats!    125: (GROANS)    126: Welcome to your first day of middle school.
127: Remember your seats. You'll be sitting here every day.    128: Rowley, if you had to say where you were ranked    129: in terms of popularity from one to 200,
130: where would you put yourself?    131: Is 200 good or bad?    132: I'd say you're somewhere around the 154 mark.    133: I'd put myself around number 19 or 20.
134: I might even have a shot at the top spot by the end of the year,    135: if things go the way I think they will.
136: Well, who's at the bottom?    137: Hey, guys, wanna see my secret freckle?    138: (BOTH GROAN)    139: GREG: Fregley. Sent home for hygiene issues at least once a month.
140: Check it out. It's got a hair in it!    141: What color is that?    142: You wanna help me name it?    143: All right, ladies! Gather around!
144: Come on, put the knitting down! Let's go!    145: All right, everybody.    146: I'm Coach Malone and I am your gym teacher.
147: P.E. Is as much a part of my life    148: as waking up in the morning and going to the bathroom.    149: I live and breathe Physical Education.
150: Now, who's with me?    151: Are you ready to have some fun out there?    152: Yeah!    153: MALONE: All right, outstanding!    154: So we're gonna divide you up into two teams.
155: So you two, over here. You, you, you, this way.    156: Yeah, you three, this side. Good.    157: You guys are going to be Shirts!
158: And you will be Skins.    159: Why are we Skins? I hate this.    160: He's just trying to make kids like us feel bad.    161: What do you mean, kids like us?
162: I just don't want to get a sunburn, right, Rowley?    163: (IN ROBOTIC VOICE) My name is Bell E. Button.    164: What's yours?
165: Okay, let's start off with a little game I like to call Gladiator.    166: (BO YS EX CLAIMING)    167: - BO Y 1: I got this one! - BO Y 2: No!
168: BO Y 3: Take that!    169: (GRUNTS)    170: (NEVER MISS A BEA TPLAYING)    171: Cover me!    172: Oh, God.    173: Not good!    174: We're never going to be able to outrun these guys!
175: We don't have to outrun them!    176: We just have to outrun Chirag!    177: Take a look, take a look, take a look    178: At the kids on the street
179: No, they never miss a beat    180: Never miss a beat    181: Never miss a beat    182: Never miss a beat    183: Never miss a beat    184: - Think they saw us? - No way.
185: They were focused on getting that kid with the limp.    186: We'll hide here for the rest of the class because I'm not playing that game.
187: It's not fair.    188: He's got all the Neanderthals on the same team. It's barbaric!    189: ANGIE: It's completely barbaric.
190: This place is an intellectual wasteland.    191: But, you know, it's nice to meet someone    192: more interested in his mind than in his body.
193: You girls get to jump rope. What are you doing hiding?    194: Avoiding the pain.    195: It all starts in middle school, you know?
196: You're not a kid anymore. The coddling has stopped.    197: Kids are now separated by intelligence. The weak are picked on.
198: And girls you've known since kindergarten won't even talk to you anymore.    199: Okay, well, sounds like you got it all figured out,
200: so go back to your book.    201: This place is a glorified holding pen.    202: MALONE: All the way! All the way! You're like a machine!
203: ANGIE: It's where adults put you    204: as you make that awkward transition between child and teenager    205: so they don't even have to look at you.
206: Hi. I'm Angie.    207: Great story. We're gonna go now.    208: Why? This is a good spot.    209: It's a perfect spot.    210: I survived all of the sixth grade here.
211: And I would enjoy some like-minded company    212: to get me through the seventh.    213: Is that the whistle? I think I hear the whistle.
214: We need to go.    215: MALONE: No showboating, all right?    216: Why are we leaving?    217: We could get killed out here in the open!
218: Put your shirt on. They'll think we're on their team.    219: Besides, getting crushed is better than being seen with that freak job.
220: Trust me, you can't recover from social suicide.    221: I never talked to a girl that long before.    222: Whoa!    223: Check that out.
224: Is that cheese?    225: Stop!    226: Good God, man! You almost got the Cheese Touch.    227: - The what? - The Cheese Touch.    228: Nobody knows when or how,
229: but one day that cheese mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.    230: Nobody knew who it belonged to.    231: Nobody touched it. Nobody threw it away.
232: And so there it sat,    233: growing more foul and powerful by the day.    234: Then one day, a kid named Darren Walsh made the biggest mistake of his life.
235: Darren touched the cheese!    236: No, I didn't! I just looked at it! Really!    237: CHIRAG: Darren had the Cheese Touch!
238: It was worse than nuclear cooties.    239: He became an outcast.    240: (CRYING)    241: The only way to get rid of the Cheese Touch
242: was by passing it on to someone else.    243: (SCREAMS)    244: And so began the Cheese Touch Frenzy.    245: Friend turning on friend.
246: Brother turning on sister.    247: It was madness.    248: Until a German exchange student named Dieter Muller took it away.
249: Dieter has the Cheese Touch!    250: Ze Cheese Touch?    251: Vat is it?    252: Vat does it mean, ze Cheese Touch??    253: Sadly for Dieter, that fact was lost in translation.
254: Nooooooooo...!    255: Thankfully, he moved back to Düsseldorf and took the Cheese Touch with him.    256: And so the cheese sits, patiently waiting for its next victim.
257: - Wow. - Wow.    258: This is a terrible place.    259: - No doors? - None.    260: I'm not pooping until I'm in high school.    261: GREG: The cafeteria, possibly the cruelest place on Earth.
262: But I was about to make some kid's day by sitting next to him.    263: That seat's saved.    264: For who?    265: It's saved.    266: That one's saved, too.
267: So not happening.    268: Uh-uh-uh.    269: Taken.    270: Where are we supposed to eat?    271: I guess this is where all the cool guys hang out.
272: (SNEEZES)    273: Fregley must have bumped his head when he was little, like, really hard.    274: (BURPS)    275: Okay, okay,    276: so my first day could have gone better,
277: but at least I wasn't humiliated.    278: Hey, Greg! You want to come over and play?    279: (KIDS LAUGHING)    280: What did he just say to you?
281: Oh.    282: I think my ride's here.    283: Hey, guys. So this guy says to that guy,    284: "You wanna come over and play?"    285: Yeah! Do you guys wanna play with us?
286: (BO YS LAUGHING)    287: See? This is the problem.    288: Right now I have to take abuse from these morons.    289: But in 20 years, Quentin here will be working for me.
290: Greg, please don't fire me.    291: I really need my measly, pathetic job scooping your dog's poop.    292: Whatever. I'll think about it.
293: No, no, no. Vanilla on the bottom and chocolate on the top!    294: I can't eat this!    295: "Play," Rowley? "Play"?    296: I've told you, like, a billion times that guys our age say "hang out," not "play."
297: Oops.    298: Seriously, if you're not gonna listen to me, just tell me,    299: 'cause if you pull another stunt like that,
300: we'll be stuck on the cafeteria floor for the rest of middle school.    301: I found half a Snickers bar down there.
302: I can't be the guy who eats off his lap in the cafeteria.    303: I should be at the top of the food chain by now.
304: Something's got to change, fast.    305: My mom told me to just be myself and people would like me.    306: That would be good advice if you were somebody else.
307: (LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)    308: Hey, little brother.    309: Was your first day as crappy as I said it would be?    310: No. Not at all. You were wrong.
311: - It was actually better than I... - Worse.    312: (CHUCKLES)    313: You didn't listen to me, did you?    314: I told you not to talk, look or go anywhere, and what happened?
315: He had to eat his lunch on the floor.    316: - Rowley. - (LAUGHING) Perfect.    317: And if nobody wants you sitting at their table,
318: you think they want Chummy Buttons over here?    319: I was right. You're not even gonna make it out of there alive.
320: The only chance you have of making the yearbook is    321: when they dedicate it to your memory.    322: So you wanna play Twisted Wizard?
323: No. I have a better idea.    324: If he catches you in here, he will kill you.    325: Literally, kill you.    326: Don't worry. As long as we hear the music, we're okay.
327: (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)    328: Whoa. Yeah. Wow.    329: I didn't know Rodrick was into motorcycles.    330: - I found it. - Found what?
331: Rodrick's middle school yearbook.    332: This thing holds all the answers.    333: Rowley, this thing is like a bible.
334: See this? This is where a person like me needs to be.    335: The class favorites.    336: They're the best in their class.
337: These people aren't nobodies. They're famous.    338: They don't have to worry about getting a seat in the cafeteria, either.
339: Check this out. There's tons of things I qualify for.    340: "Most Likely To Succeed," "Best Looking," "Class Clown."
341: They should just give that to me right now.    342: Don't you have to be funny for that?    343: Hey! We could try for cutest friends!
344: What did I tell you would happen if you ever went in my room again?    345: But your band is still playing.    346: It's the bass solo, Turd Burglar! Don't you know anything about music?
347: Now, I came up here to get a new drumstick,    348: and now, Greg, since Mom and Dad are gone,    349: I'm going to kill you. Literally, kill you!
350: I told you.    351: Beat it.    352: Okay, but I just want to say one thing!    353: - Run, Greg, run! - What?    354: Let go, Baby Hippo!
355: (LAUGHING)    356: You're gonna have to come out sometime, loser!    357: I'll wait here as long as it takes.    358: And then, you're dead.
359: Time out, Rodrick. I have to pee.    360: (CHUCKLES) No time outs. Only death!    361: - But I really have to go. - Don't care.
362: (WATER GURGLING)    363: (GURGLING)    364: (EX CLAIMS)    365: (SIGHS)    366: (HUMMING)    367: Move over! I'm dying.    368: (SIGHING DEEPLY)    369: Got you!    370: (SCREAMING)
371: Greg, did you throw Manny off his...    372: What is going on?    373: Greg started it. I just came in here to take a shower.
374: He's lying! He was gonna kill me 'cause I was in his room!    375: And so you peed on him?    376: Yes. I mean, no. I mean...
377: Yes.    378: (WHISTLING)    379: (ALL CHATTERING)    380: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)    381: Wow, there's a lot to sign up for.    382: You could be class favorite in a bunch of things.
383: Jazz dancing!    384: We could do that one together!    385: I can't believe all these activities. They're all so much work.
386: Staying after school, meeting before school, on weekends.    387: What kind of extracurricular activities are these?
388: Out of my way.    389: Who let you into this school, Greg Heffley?    390: I was thinking the same thing about you, Patty Farrell.
391: You listen to me, Greg Heffley.    392: I'm running for student council president and I'm warning you,    393: if you get in my way, I will beat you up,
394: just like I did in kindergarten and fourth grade.    395: Fourth grade? That one was ugly.    396: What's her problem? What did I ever do to her?
397: Patty, Patty is a fatty, has a face just like a ratty!    398: (CRYING)    399: (ALL LAUGHING)    400: Come on, that was pretty funny. She needs to get a sense of humor.
401: And I need something to make me a class favorite.    402: ANGIE: What about class favorites?    403: Don't you ever say hi or hello before you start talking?
404: - Hi. - Hello.    405: Oh, Greg's only here because he really wants to be something...    406: Rowley!    407: I was just saying that I would really like to nail these people
408: because it's so obvious that    409: they're only doing these activities to get in the yearbook.    410: You know, I like your point of view.
411: You should sign up for the school paper. We're the voice of the people.    412: Well, the people are mostly idiots, so I guess, technically speaking,
413: we're the voice of the people making fun of the people.    414: Thanks, but I can't be on the paper because I'm gonna be in the paper a lot.
415: So that would be a conflict of interest.    416: You're the people. Got it.    417: Do you believe me now? That girl is crazy town.
418: Look! They have wrestling!    419: That's it! I'm great at wrestling.    420: I've watched it for years, I know all the moves.
421: Tombstone piledriver.    422: Chair shot.    423: Vader Bomb.    424: AUDIENCE: Heffley! Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!    425: Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!
426: Okay. Something is very wrong here.    427: These don't look like wrestling costumes to me.    428: Welcome to wrestling, you future Olympians!
429: So, just to make sure we all get off on the right foot    430: and nobody gets seriously injured,    431: we're gonna teach you a few basic moves.
432: Remember, this is about learning the sport and having fun!    433: All right. It's not a competition    434: because everyone here is already a superstar to me.
435: Coach Brewer, can you step over here for a moment,    436: please, give me a hand? Thanks.    437: (GRUNTS)    438: (ALL EX CLAIM)
439: That's known as a speed takedown.    440: Nice job, Coach Brewer.    441: Can you get up and come behind me?    442: Put one arm over my shoulder? Let's go, yeah.
443: You got it, walk it off, come on.    444: That was known as the arm drag.    445: Let's give Coach Brewer a hand, everybody!
446: He's fine.    447: Yeah, Heffley.    448: What about piledrivers and Vader bombs?    449: That is fake wrestling.    450: This is real wrestling! Let's go!
451: If I have to wrestle Benny Wells, he'll kill me!    452: MALONE: Let's move! Come on!    453: Okay, to keep things fair, I've divided you into weight categories by your size,
454: so Rottweilers over here.    455: Bulldogs, you stay right there.    456: And we got two    457: Chihuahuas. Yeah.    458: Nice head gear.
459: Thanks. My mom let me borrow it.    460: All right, let's see what you got.    461: (WHISTLE BLOWS)    462: Don't worry, Fregley, I'll take it easy on you.
463: (EX CLAIMING)    464: Hey, I wasn't ready!    465: Nobody's keeping score, but that was a sweet speed takedown, Fregley!
466: This is fun, Greg Heffley!    467: Get off me!    468: ALL: (CHANTING) Fregley! Fregley! Fregley!    469: Blow the whistle, blow the whistle!
470: All right! Fregley!    471: Outstanding!    472: And let's... Let's hear it for our other winner.    473: Yay, Greg!    474: I can't lose to Fregley again.
475: If I get beat by the weirdest kid in school,    476: nobody's ever gonna let me sit at their table.    477: How are you going to beat him? It's like he had superhuman strength!
478: I'm not gonna beat him. I'm gonna gain 10 pounds this week    479: so I can move up to the Bulldog weight class.
480: And then you and I can wrestle each other.    481: Ready?    482: - Can I throw at you now? - Later.    483: You're better at riding than I am, and I'm a better thrower.
484: (SIGHS)    485: Greg, save some for everybody else, honey.    486: GREG: Can't. I need to bulk up.    487: Why?    488: I think your body looks beautiful just the way it is.
489: I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling. Now what is wrong with you?    490: Why would you sign up for something you don't have to do?
491: You signed up for wrestling?    492: Kind of.    493: You never sign up for anything at school.    494: You fly below the radar.
495: That way you never raise anyone's expectations.    496: Thank you, Rodrick, for those words of motivational wisdom,
497: but perhaps a better way to look at it is that    498: it's a chance to learn to excel at something.    499: Well, what could I learn at school that I can't teach myself?
500: Well, Greg, I think it's great that    501: you took the initiative to learn something new.    502: This is like the first step to responsibility!
503: My boss's son Will was smaller than you,    504: but he built himself up with the weights!    505: Yeah. We could get you the same equipment.
506: You could train, get the right nutrition, cardio.    507: You'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.    508: And it would only take, like, three months.
509: - Three months? - Yeah.    510: I'll just stick to eating.    511: Well, I don't know where you put it, Heffley,    512: but you gained 10 pounds and joined the Bulldog class.
513: Yes.    514: I thought you didn't gain any weight this week.    515: My mom's ankle weights.    516: All right, bulldog Heffley. Meet your new opponent.
517: What? But this is boys' wrestling.    518: Ever hear of Title IX?    519: Her parents threatened to sue,    520: so you show her what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.
521: (PATTY GRUNTS)    522: Come on! What you waiting for, huh? Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.    523: - Make your move! - She's a girl! Where do I grab her?
524: - Stay down! - ANGIE: Patty, over here!    525: - Get off of me! - Can I wrestle somebody good now?    526: (ALL LAUGHING)
527: Well, look who's in the paper.    528: Greg! You're famous! Right on the front page!    529: And if I would have pinned her, which I could have done easily,
530: you know I would have gotten in trouble for hurting a girl.    531: Why does she even want to wrestle?    532: Who knows? Girls are very confusing.
533: Like today, I heard someone in the hallway say    534: that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt. What does that even mean?
535: A butt can't be cute. It's a butt.    536: I know, but that's what they were saying.    537: I don't see why girls our age can't talk just like regular people.
538: So how are you gonna become a class favorite now?    539: - Two words. Best Dressed. - How are you going to do that?
540: Fashion is easy. You wear a shirt and a tie, and kids are impressed.    541: I'm telling you, this is gonna work.
542: (SINGING) I light 'em up before the motor starts    543: I go so fast that I could never stop    544: Look under the hood but you don't know what I got
545: I'm a moving violation, baby    546: Hot, hot, hot, hot    547: Ta-da!    548: - I told you I was wearing this. - I know!    549: - I wanted to be matchers! - BO Y: Check them out!
550: ALL: (SINGING) Greg and Rowley sitting in a tree    551: K-l-S-S-l-N-G    552: First comes love...    553: GREG: You know, maybe Rodrick was right about Rowley.
554: Maybe I do need a new best friend.    555: But I can't just ditch him.    556: I mean, if anybody has a better idea, I'd love to hear it.
557: NARRATOR: In this school, much like your own,    558: one boy is about to learn an important lesson    559: about self-worth and esteem.
560: Gag me with a spoon.    561: That guy is so unpopular, I'd hate to be him.    562: (SIGHS)    563: Why doesn't anybody like me?    564: BROCK: Maybe because they don't know how awesome you really are.
565: Brock Branigan P.I.! What are you doing here?    566: I'm here to solve the case of the boy who just needed to be himself.
567: So go for it! Show them how awesome you really are!    568: Hey, guys. Do you like break dancing?    569: (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
570: That is totally rad!    571: Wicked. You should sit with us at lunch, friend.    572: Sweet!    573: It really is awesome to be me! Thanks, Brock.
574: Okay. Let's talk about what we've learned.    575: GREG: I don't know about anyone else, but I know what I learned.
576: It is awesome to be me.    577: The problem with Rowley is that he's not enough like me.    578: I can't ditch him 'cause he'd be lost without me.
579: But maybe I can fix him.    580: Because that's the kind of friend I am.    581: What are you doing?    582: Making your clothes more middle-school friendly.
583: Look at this stuff. Too babyish and weird.    584: Too "Why don't you just punch me now?"    585: What are you, a foreign exchange student?
586: Oh, man. This one we burn.    587: That was a present from my mom.    588: Well, then your mom is trying to get you killed.
589: Ready? Steady. Go.    590: No, no, no. You look like one of the Seven Dwarfs.    591: You only need one strap. One strap is cool.
592: But there's two straps.    593: Why would they put on two straps if you're only supposed to use one?    594: Because the guys who make backpacks aren't cool.
595: If they were cool, they'd give it one strap, like the cool one-strap guys do.    596: You know what has one strap? Machine guns.
597: You know what else? Electric guitars.    598: - You know what else? - Purses?    599: - But Joshie is cool. - Rowley, Joshie is not cool.
600: He's a lip-synching pop star whose fans are eight-year-old girls.    601: You're just jealous that I was the one who discovered him.
602: Who are you gonna listen to, Rowley? Me or Joshie?    603: Joshie says to respect your parents and follow your dreams.
604: Then Joshie must get beaten up a lot.    605: You actually almost look as good as me.    606: Am I great at this or what?
607: There's Bryce Anderson. Just be cool.    608: - Hey, Bryce. - Yeah, hey, Bryce!    609: Cute butt!    610: You're killing me, you know that?
611: Look, Rowley, tonight's Halloween, our favorite night of the year,    612: so, just promise me you won't wear, do or say anything weird.
613: (DOORBELL RINGS)    614: You're kidding me, right?    615: (SIGHS) My mom wanted me to be visible at night.    616: From space?    617: So, we'll hit a few houses on the way to the North Side,
618: which is where we'll do most of our trick-or-treating.    619: Why are we going all the way over there?    620: It's where the rich people live.
621: They hand out, like, two, three pieces of big candy to each kid.    622: Not that candy corn crap.    623: I'm talking about full-size Milky Ways and Nutter Butters.
624: Plus, if we time it right,    625: rich people get tired of answering their doors and just leave the bowl out.    626: We can clean up.
627: ROWLEY: Wow, you're lucky.    628: My mom doesn't let me play with makeup anymore.    629: Shut up, tool. Löded Diper's got a gig tonight.
630: Mmm.    631: Going to the North Side, huh?    632: Takes you right past the Devil Worshiper Woods.    633: The Devil Worshiper Woods?
634: You know about that story, right?    635: Well, there used to be this house right here where these woods are.    636: They had to tear it down because what happened there was so terrible.
637: What happened there?    638: Well, a long time ago, two kids who were, I don't know,    639: maybe in middle school,    640: they trick-or-treated at that house on Halloween night.
641: But the house was full of devil worshipers    642: who put the kids in these giant pizza ovens.    643: And they cooked them and they ate them.
644: But they forgot to turn off the ovens.    645: So the house burned down with everyone in it.    646: How'd the trees get there?
647: And then they planted trees.    648: Oh.    649: And to this day, on Halloween night,    650: you can still hear the demonic laughter of the devil worshiper ghosts
651: as they roam the woods, looking for more kids to sacrifice!    652: Hey, Rodrick. I need you to help me out. Like...
653: (DOORBELL RINGS)    654: Are you wearing eyeliner?    655: - KIDS: Trick or treat. - Susan!    656: - I'm on door duty! - GIRL: Thank you.
657: Bubby!    658: Mom, can you tell him to stop calling me that?    659: What if somebody hears?    660: Then they'll know how much he loves you.
661: Frank, Frank, honey, honey, can you go with them?    662: No, I can't. I got to guard the house in case someone tries to T.P. Us.
663: They're gonna get drenched from the roof.    664: (LAUGHS)    665: Honey, for goodness sakes, don't do that again.    666: Remember what happened last year?
667: I got you!    668: (CRYING)    669: Hi.    670: I thought they were teenagers.    671: And I couldn't see through the bushes. My legs, they hurt from the squatting.
672: So, that's why I'm doing it from the roof this year.    673: So I can see when they're coming.    674: Can we go now?    675: (DOORBELL RINGS)
676: Yes, go.    677: - But stay in the neighborhood. - KIDS: Trick or treat.    678: - And no North Side! - We promise!    679: GREG: We got to stay in this neighborhood the rest of the night.
680: That guy gave me two full-size Snickers!    681: Did I tell you or did I tell you? These people have money to burn!
682: (LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO)    683: ROWLEY: I can't believe we got this much candy.    684: This is, like, the best day ever.
685: CARTER: Hey, reflector dude, nice costume!    686: Thanks! My mom made it...    687: (EX CLAIMING)    688: (BO YS LAUGHING)    689: - CARTER: Oh, that was awesome! - I saw your plates! We're calling the cops!
690: Uh-oh.    691: Oh, boy.    692: Run!    693: CARTER: Hey, they're going through the yard!    694: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!    695: Where are we going? We're totally exposed!
696: - My grandma's house! - Quickly!    697: They're coming!    698: (RINGING DOORBELL)    699: - Hello? - That's not helping! She's not home!
700: - Bingo night. - CARTER: Okay, you guys are dead.    701: ROWLEY: Open the door! Get the key! GREG: Okay. Okay.    702: - ROWLEY: Open the door! Get it! - Come on, let's get them, boys.
703: ROWLEY: They're coming!    704: ROWLEY: Now! CARTER: Oh, I got you now!    705: PETE: Hey, hey!    706: Come on, you babies!    707: I'm gonna kick your butts!
708: - Yeah? You and what army? - Whatever.    709: (BOTH BABBLING)    710: You guys are so lucky you can hide in there behind your mommy!
711: No, we aren't! It's not our house!    712: It's his grandma's and she's not even home!    713: (LAUGHING)    714: What? Why would you tell them that?
715: CARTER: (SOFTLY) Did he just say that?    716: Oops.    717: Now they're never gonna leave. You need to call your mom to come get us.
718: Mine'll kill me if she knows we're here.    719: Mine will, too. She thinks you're a bad influence.    720: She's right.
721: Then we're gonna have to bust out of here.    722: - PETE: You have any threes? - Go fish.    723: (CREAKING)    724: Hey, what's that?
725: (D ANGER! HIGH VOL TAGEPLAYING)    726: Danger, danger    727: High Voltage    728: (LAUGHING)    729: Danger, danger    730: High Voltage    731: Just back off! I don't want to hurt anybody,
732: we just want to walk away and forget this ever happened.    733: Nobody needs to be a hero! Whoa!    734: Are you kidding me?
735: I'm gonna rip off your arms and punch you in the face with your own fists!    736: - They're gaining! - This way!
737: The Devil Worshiper Woods! No way!    738: PETE: Hey! Stay right there! We're gonna get you!    739: (PANTING) They're going into the woods.
740: (PANTING) No, no way I go into Devil Worshiper Woods. Uh-uh.    741: This isn't over!    742: - ROWLEY: I'm really scared! - Just keep running!
743: (ROWLEY PANTING)    744: (LOUD LAUGHTER)    745: ROWLEY: Did you hear that? It's the devil worshipers.    746: (LOUD LAUGHTER)    747: (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
748: (BOTH SCREAMING)    749: Guys?    750: - Are we safe? - Yeah.    751: And we made it with still a ton of candy.    752: Sorry. I was... I thought you were teenagers.
753: - BO Y: Maybe next year, Pops! - Hey!    754: (SNIFFING)    755: (GROANS)    756: So anyone else exhibiting symptoms of pink eye    757: should contact the nurse immediately.
758: In field trip news, consent forms are going out today    759: for our annual History of Plumbing excursion.    760: In sports news...

764: (TEACHER SHUSHING)    765: And finally, some positions have opened up for the Safety Patrol.    766: If anyone is interested, see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.
767: GREG: Now that's what I'm talking about.    768: Safety Patrol. The cops of middle school.    769: You boss people around, report the jerks, and miss class three times a week.
770: MR. WINSKY: Safety Patrol is a sacred trust.    771: When you put on this vest and that badge you become a protector of the weak.
772: You become an enforcer of the laws of this school,    773: because today's litterer and jaywalker    774: is tomorrow's window breaker and graffiti vandal,
775: and it's our job to stop it.    776: So I ask you, are you up for the job?    777: - Yes! - Yes!    778: Then welcome to Safety Patrol.
779: Just remember, with great power...    780: - Whoa. ...comes great responsibility.    781: Now, you get your first assignment just after lunch,
782: so you'll be excused from the first 20 minutes of sixth period.    783: But that means we'll miss Algebra... Ouch!
784: Do we get free stuff?    785: - Free hot cocoa. - Could this day get any better?    786: Whoa, is that cocoa?    787: - Sorry, Safety Patrol only. - Sorry.
788: You rejected the school paper, but you joined the Safety Patrol?    789: Look, are you working your way down the evolutionary ladder?
790: What?    791: Look, Safety Patrol is the lowest of the low,    792: the geekiest of the geeky, the Island of Misfit Toys.
793: You're just jealous they don't trust you to keep our school safe.    794: Now if you'll excuse me, I need to secure the perimeter.

798: Greg! It's those guys from Halloween!    799: What do we do?    800: Come on, man, just pull my finger. I swear to God, I'm not gonna do anything.
801: Everybody, shoulder to shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder.    802: - GREG: Go. Go! - Whoa, whoa.    803: - That was close. - Too close.
804: (BOTH LAUGHING)    805: GREG: It's times like these that make me realize    806: Rowley's pretty lucky to have me as a friend.
807: ROWLEY: And I got Twisted Wizard Two, and a new bike!    808: And we're going to take a family trip to New York City for New Year's Eve!
809: - What did you get? - My dad got me a weight-lifting set.    810: Do you know how many video games I could've gotten instead?
811: I had to get out of there before he expected me to, like, use it.    812: Anyway, let's play some Twisted Wizard Two at your house.
813: Probably not a good idea. My dad's still annoyed at you.    814: For what?    815: Remember that secret language we made up last week?
816: Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa like-pa a woman-pa.    817: (BOTH LAUGHING)    818: I think he cracked our code.    819: We should probably do something outside.
820: ROWLEY: Why can't you ride and I throw at you first?    821: My legs kind of hurt from walking over here.    822: (SIGHS)
823: (SCREAMING)    824: (GRUNTS)    825: Okay, Rowley. Come on. Get up.    826: (ROWLEY GROANING)    827: Shake it off.    828: Are you sure the doctor was right? It really didn't look that broken to me.
829: Yeah, it's broken. The X-ray never lies.    830: - Oh, my gosh. What happened? - I broke it.    831: - SHELLY: How? - Big Wheel accident.
832: You're funny.    833: - Can I sign your cast? - Me, too.    834: - I wanna sign it, too. - Why, sure.    835: Hey, I'm the one who broke his hand.
836: Then you're a jerk.    837: - (WHISPERS) Sorry. - GIRL: Does it hurt?    838: (EX CLAIMS)    839: SHELLY: Rowley, you're so funny.
840: - After I stood... - GREG: I couldn't believe it!    841: Rowley was eating at an actual table because of something I did!
842: Where's my credit?    843: And he's right handed! He can feed himself just fine.    844: So, how's that class favorite thing working out for you?
845: Great.    846: (WHOOPING)    847: I realized Rowley's injury thing was a pretty good racket.    848: (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)    849: - MARLEY: It's gonna be so much fun. - Hey, guys. Check it out.
850: Oh, my gosh, what happened?    851: It's a raging infection caused by a splinter that was left untreated.    852: Want to be the first to sign my sympathy sheet?
853: No.    854: I'll sign it, Greg Heffley, if you'd let me look at your infection.    855: ROWLEY: And on the X-ray, you could see where the bone just snapped right in half.
856: I had the exact same break last year, and it got all purple!    857: - ROWLEY: Cool! Mine, too! - Hey, Gregory, want to sign the card?
858: You got Rowley a card?    859: What? No, it's for Bryan Little.    860: You know, the guy who writes the Wacky Dawg cartoons
861: for the school paper?    862: He has mono and he's going to be out for three months.    863: That really stinks.    864: So, just out of curiosity, who's gonna do the cartoon?
865: They're having tryouts, but the important thing is Bryan gets better.    866: Absolutely.    867: GREG: Bryan Little getting mono was destiny.
868: I draw cartoons all the time. I'm gonna win this.    869: I decided to go ahead and forgive Rowley for milking the broken hand so hard
870: and I told him he could work on the cartoon with me.    871: So, I was thinking we could do something like this!
872: Oops, I stepped in a puddle!    873: At least it's not an acid puddle.    874: Oy, oy, oy! It is an acid puddle!    875: Zoo-wee Mama!
876: Zoo-wee Mama!    877: It's the same joke every time.    878: Yeah! Zoo-wee Mama!    879: We can't just do the same thing over and over.
880: We can if it's Zoo-wee Mama.    881: It has to be a little more sophisticated.    882: GREG: (IMITATES CREIGHTON) I wonder what is in this cute little box.
883: GREG: (IMITATES CREIGHTON'S FRIEND) It's not a box, it's a brick, you dumb moron.    884: GREG: (IMITATES CREIGHTON) Oops! I've been trying to open it all day!
885: - Can he say, "Zoo-wee Mama"? - No, it's not funny.    886: Well, I think it is. I like Zoo-wee Mama.    887: You know what? If you like it so much, then why don't you go do it yourself?
888: Okay. I will.    889: See you.    890: (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)    891: Hey, I forgot my raincoat, so I'm gonna need you to walk the kids home today.
892: I can't. I can't get my cast wet. You can borrow my coat.    893: GIRL: Where's Rowley?    894: - He couldn't get his cast wet! - He walks us better!
895: Oh, no.    896: Oh, my gosh! Space monsters!    897: They're going to eat us, unless we can get into that hole!    898: Come on, people, move it! Now, people! We're gonna get eaten!
899: Come on! Don't worry! I'm right behind you!    900: - Whoa! - Go!    901: Hey!    902: Rowley Jefferson, is that you?    903: Yes, Mrs. Irvine!
904: Sorry, kids!    905: Are you going to eat us?    906: And though doctors assure us that Mrs. Cheznik is no longer contagious,
907: the cafeteria nachos bar will be closed for the remainder of the week.    908: And now, what you've all been waiting for.
909: The faculty, Student Council and editors have all met    910: and selected the new cartoonist for the school paper.
911: And the winner is "Zoo-wee Mama" by Rowley Jefferson!    912: (ALL CHEERING)    913: - What? - That is funny!    914: BO Y: Great job.
915: - Zoo-wee Mama. - GREG: I couldn't believe it.    916: Am I the only one who gets comedy?    917: - Rowley, will you put me in your cartoon? - Sure.
918: And me, too. I want to be the one who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."    919: - You got it! - Hey, Rowley, congratulations.
920: - Thanks. - No problem.    921: You know, I read all the submissions and yours was by far the best.    922: I read yours, too.
923: - BRYCE: Hey, Rowley. - Hey, Bryce.    924: - Yeah, hey, Bryce. - Hey, fella.    925: Wow. Everyone knows me now.    926: - It's like I'm famous! Isn't this great? - Yeah.
927: Rowley Jefferson? I need to see you in my office, now.    928: (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)    929: MR. WINSKY: I just took a call from a Mrs. Irvine
930: about what happened to the kindergarteners last week.    931: She was very upset. And so am I.    932: - What? - You violated the sacred trust.
933: This...    934: This badge is supposed to mean something, and you just spat on it.    935: I can barely even look at you.
936: - I really don't... - Just save it.    937: You are officially suspended from Safety Patrol.    938: And I expect a full apology to the kindergarteners.
939: Yes, sir.    940: - Hey. What did he have to say? - I'm kicked off.    941: I don't even know what he's talking about.    942: Rowley?
943: - What? - Nothing.    944: You've been home for an hour and haven't badgered me for any snacks.    945: Are you feeling okay?
946: Well, I'm kind of in a tough situation.    947: I know something    948: and if I tell the truth about it, it could hurt somebody.
949: But if I don't, it could hurt somebody else.    950: Well, you have to trust your gut and try to do the right thing,
951: because it's our choices that make us who we are.    952: Okay.    953: GREG: I was up all night, tossing and turning,    954: thinking about my mom 's advice.
955: And I finally decided to do the right thing.    956: I'm sorry I terrorized you, children.    957: What?    958: I decided to let Rowley take one for the team.
959: But I'm not entirely sure that was the right call.    960: Hey, how's it going?    961: Well, I was pretty upset about being suspended from Safety Patrol,
962: but then I just started drawing a bunch of Zoo-wee Mamas and I felt better.    963: Look. I put you in this week's cartoon.
964: And you even get to say, "Zoo-wee Mama."    965: Wow. That's really    966: nice.    967: So, listen.    968: It's kind of funny, you know, the whole Safety Patrol thing.
969: Yeah?    970: Ready for the funny part?    971: Well, I'm the one who terrorized those kids!    972: - What? - Yeah,    973: and I think we can both learn some valuable lessons from this.
974: Like, I should be more careful what I do in front of Mrs. Irvine's house.    975: And you, well,    976: you should be more careful who you lend your coat to.
977: You know what, Greg? You're not a good friend.    978: Whoa. How could you even say that? I'm a great friend.    979: If you were a great friend, you would have told Mr. Winsky the truth.
980: Okay, one thing. You can't get mad about just...    981: You only care about yourself.    982: You hated my cartoon.    983: You made fun of my clothes. You disrespected Joshie.
984: You broke my hand and you didn't even seem sorry.    985: That broken hand was the best thing that ever happened to you!
986: Don't call me.    987: Don't come by my house. We're done.    988: I thought the whole thing would blow over.    989: But Rowley was still giving me the silent treatment.
990: - Even when I tried to make the first move. - Yeah.    991: ROWLEY: So, anyway, I was so angry at him, I didn't know what to say.
992: MR. WINSKY: One of the kindergarteners finally told their parents the whole story.    993: Greg? You're relieved of your Safety Patrol duties, effective immediately.
994: Rowley,    995: for showing dignity under false suspicion, I am promoting you    996: to team captain.    997: Now, that's a position that I held for two years. I know you'll honor it.
998: (YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND PLAYING)    999: Okay    1000: You're supposed to be my friend    1001: We're supposed to get along
1002: Hey, you're supposed to be my friend    1003: Hey, Rowley, my mom says it's okay for me to sleep over tonight.    1004: Awesome!
1005: GREG: The whole thing with Rowley is, I was willing to let bygones be bygones.    1006: But then he made friends with Collin just to mess with me.
1007: As if I even care if he...    1008: Well, you know what?    1009: Two can play at that game.    1010: There's no going back, Sergeant. I need to board the helicopter.
1011: Do you have my back?    1012: I will always have your back, Captain.    1013: Yeah, maybe I'll meet up with some friends    1014: Yeah, maybe I'll meet up with some dogs
1015: 'Cause you're supposed to be    1016: You're supposed to be    1017: Supposed to be my friend    1018: You're supposed to be my friend now
1019: - Hey. - Hey, Greg Heffley.    1020: So, I was thinking maybe you might want to have a sleepover?    1021: Yeah. With who?    1022: Me.
1023: - Yeah, when? - Now.    1024: Greg Heffley, I love you!    1025: We are going to be best friends forever!    1026: Wanna have a tickle fight?
1027: Okay. Let's get inside.    1028: FREGLEY: I can't believe it!    1029: Greg Heffley's in my room! Greg Heffley's in my room, Rebecca.
1030: What do you want to do, Greg Heffley? How about Twister?    1031: GREG: I'm not really that much of a Twister guy.
1032: - Candy! - Wait!    1033: No, no, no! Fregley, come on! Really!    1034: I really think we should save those for later!    1035: - Maybe we should go outside and... - My mom doesn't let me have sugar.
1036: She says high glucose in my diet induces hyperactivity.    1037: But it's so good!    1038: Greg Heffley, you want to jumpety-jump?
1039: Yeah, you know what, Fregley? I just remembered,    1040: I have an appointment, a really important appointment.    1041: It's a homework appointment. Yeah, and I really should be going.
1042: Get away from me!    1043: (EX CLAIMING)    1044: I can fly! Whoa.    1045: How fun, Greg Heffley!    1046: Greg? Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg? Greg? Greg?
1047: (BANGING ON DOOR)    1048: I hear you breathing, Greg Heffley.    1049: FREGLEY: Dear Gregory,    1050: I'm very sorry I chased you with a booger on my finger.
1051: Here, I put it on this paper so you can get me back.    1052: What?    1053: All right.    1054: GREG: Okay, enough. I'll show Rowley I don't need him.
1055: When he sees me in the yearbook as Most Talented,    1056: he's gonna come running back.    1057: Okay, since there are so many of you here auditioning,
1058: to save time, we're gonna do a group sing of one of my favorite songs.    1059: Please refer to the lyrics on this handout.
1060: I will pick out the best voices and place you accordingly.    1061: (ALL SINGING OUT OF TUNE)    1062: (GREG SINGING MELODIOUSLY)
1063: (SCOFFS)    1064: Greg Heffley, what a lovely soprano voice you have. I'm stunned!    1065: Maybe you should be Dorothy!    1066: - No, no, I can't be... - No!
1067: Greg Heffley was suspended from the school Safety Patrol!    1068: How can you trust him with the lead role in the play?
1069: He can't be Dorothy! I'm Dorothy!    1070: - All right, Patty, calm down. - I'm Dorothy! I am!    1071: My mother is the president of the P.T.A.
1072: She can ruin your life!    1073: Just an idea.    1074: (SCOFFS)    1075: All right, well, Greg, your voice is too high for any of the other male roles.
1076: Perhaps you can be a tree!    1077: A tree? No way.    1078: (SCOFFS)    1079: (WHISPERS) The trees get to throw apples at Patty Farrell.
1080: Haven't you seen the movie?    1081: (PATTY BLOWING KISSES)    1082: Wait, we don't get arm holes?    1083: How are we gonna throw apples at Dorothy without arm holes?
1084: You don't need arm holes because nobody's throwing any apples.    1085: We're not doing the movie. In my version, the trees sing.
1086: These, my dear.    1087: (ALL SINGING) Down the winding yellow road    1088: Doth she know to where it goes    1089: With her dog so small and true

1155: (SIGHS)    1156: I knew you didn't want to miss that.    1157: It looks like a lot of fun.    1158: I think you should go. I think it'd be a lot of fun.
1159: GREG: Fun? That's the exact opposite of fun!    1160: This entire year has been terrible and nobody even cares!    1161: My family, my best friend.
1162: Well, I'm sick of it. Somebody needs to pay.    1163: Okay, Manny, I'm putting this Tootsie Roll in Rodrick's backpack.
1164: It's for Rodrick, so whatever you do, don't touch the Tootsie Roll.    1165: Mmm-hmm.    1166: Greg? Coaster. Where's he...
1167: Manny? Where did you get that?    1168: Oh, my. That's offensive.    1169: (PLAYING HEAVY METAL MUSIC)    1170: Rodrick? Rodrick!    1171: I need to talk to you inside! Now!

1175: No, it was in my room.    1176: (EX CLAIMS)    1177: Does owning this magazine make you a better person?    1178: - No. - Did it make you more popular at school?

1204: Hi!    1205: Well, if we're not here to dance, maybe you should go talk to Rowley.    1206: I think it's time you two made up.
1207: I can't.    1208: Sweetheart, he's your best friend.    1209: And sometimes, when somebody's worth it,    1210: you just have to put yourself out there.
1211: I wouldn't know what to say.    1212: Well, I could go for an ice cream after the dance.    1213: Maybe you could invite him to join us.
1214: Yeah.    1215: Hey, Rowley.    1216: Hey.    1217: So you want to go get some ice cream after?    1218: I'm sorry. We already have plans.    1219: Yeah. We do.
1220: Oh, fine. My mom wanted me to ask. So I did.    1221: I didn't even want to go.    1222: Well?    1223: Honey, I'm sorry.    1224: (INTERGALACTIC PLAYING)

1306: I ate the cheese!    1307: Yeah. I ate it.    1308: And you know what, people? I just did you all a huge favor.    1309: I ate the cheese to show you all how stupid this whole school is.
1310: The wrong friends.    1311: The wrong lunch table.    1312: The wrong butt?    1313: It's all meaningless.    1314: Just like this cheese.    1315: I know it. You all know it.

1331: Maybe try to get out there a little next year.    1332: You know what, Patty?    1333: One day middle school will end and become high school.
1334: And after that, it just becomes life.    1335: And all those things you think are important now won't be anymore.
1336: (SCOFFS) You wish.    1337: (EX CLAIMING) As if!    1338: Handing it to you is like touching you    1339: and I am way too smart to touch somebody who ate the cheese.
