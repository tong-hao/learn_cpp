Okay, first of all,
let me get something straight.

37
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,402
This is a journal, not a diary.

Yeah, I know what it says on the cover.

But when my mom went out
to buy this thing,

00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,363
I specifically told her
not to buy one that said "diary" on it.

This just proves Mom doesn't understand
anything about kids my age.

- Sissy!

43
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,882
The only reason I agreed to
write in this thing is because

44
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,248
when I'm rich and famous
I'll have better things to do

51
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,168
Mom got me this thing

52
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,892
so I could write down my feelings
about starting middle school.

they'd start the story here.

00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,888
nobody's ever gonna let me
sit at their table.

477
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:53,409
How are you going to beat him?
It's like he had superhuman strength!

478
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,162
I'm not gonna beat him.
I'm gonna gain 10 pounds this week

479
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:58,209
so I can move up to
the Bulldog weight class.

480
00:26:58,293 --> 00:27:00,887
And then you and I can wrestle each other.

481
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:02,292
Ready?

482
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:04,284
- Can I throw at you now?
- Later.

483
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,445
You're better at riding than I am,
and I'm a better thrower.

Greg, save some for everybody else,
honey.

486
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,370
GREG: Can't. I need to bulk up.

487
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:25,442
Why?

488
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,891
I think your body looks beautiful
just the way it is.

489
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:32,483
I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?

490
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:35,804
Why would you sign up for something
you don't have to do?

491
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:38,129
You signed up for wrestling?

492
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,282
Kind of.

493
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:41,841
You never sign up for anything at school.

494
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:43,764
You fly below the radar.

495
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:46,765
That way you never raise
anyone's expectations.

496
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,686
Thank you, Rodrick,
for those words of motivational wisdom,

497
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,684
but perhaps
a better way to look at it is that

498
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:54,810
it's a chance
to learn to excel at something.

499
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:58,090
Well, what could I learn at school
that I can't teach myself?

500
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,607
Well, Greg, I think it's great that

501
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:02,888
you took the initiative
to learn something new.

502
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:06,010
This is like the first step to responsibility!

503
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:09,529
My boss's son Will was smaller than you,

504
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:12,252
but he built himself up with the weights!

505
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,403
Yeah.
We could get you the same equipment.

506
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:18,725
You could train,
get the right nutrition, cardio.

507
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:22,523
You'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.

508
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,367
And it would only take, like, three months.

509
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,884
- Three months?
- Yeah.

510
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:37,329
I'll just stick to eating.

511
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,087
Well, I don't know
where you put it, Heffley,

512
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:46,607
but you gained 10 pounds
and joined the Bulldog class.

513
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:47,762
Yes.

514
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,561
I thought
you didn't gain any weight this week.

515
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,325
My mom's ankle weights.

516
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:04,168
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.

517
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,808
What? But this is boys' wrestling.

Ever hear of Title IX?

00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:12,726
Her parents threatened to sue,

520
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:16,488
so you show her
what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.

Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.

523
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:30,249
- Make your move!
- She's a girl! Where do I grab her?

- Stay down!
- ANGIE: Patty, over here!

Greg! You're famous!
Right on the front page!

529
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:11,406
And if I would have pinned her,
which I could have done easily,

530
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,848
you know I would have gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl.

531
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:16,083
Why does she even want to wrestle?

532
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:18,209
Who knows? Girls are very confusing.

533
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:19,772
Like today,
I heard someone in the hallway say

534
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:23,687
that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?

535
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:26,082
A butt can't be cute. It's a butt.

536
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:29,201
I know, but that's what they were saying.

537
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:32,012
I don't see why girls our age
can't talk just like regular people.

- How are you going to do that?

Fashion is easy. You wear a shirt
and a tie, and kids are impressed.

Why would they put on two straps

Well, there used to be this house
right here where these woods are.

636

They had to tear it down because
what happened there was so terrible.

What happened there?

638
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:33,611
Well, a long time ago,
two kids who were, I don't know,

639
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:36,284
maybe in middle school,

640
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:39,885
they trick-or-treated at that house
on Halloween night.

641
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:45,969
But the house was full of devil worshipers

642
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:50,168
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens.

643
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,569
And they cooked them and they ate them.

644
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,722
But they forgot to turn off the ovens.

645
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:59,930
So the house burned down
with everyone in it.

646

How'd the trees get there?

647

00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:08,643
And I expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners.

939
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:10,640
Yes, sir.

940
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:23,444
- Hey. What did he have to say?
- I'm kicked off.

941
00:55:24,012 --> 00:55:26,082
I don't even know what he's talking about.

942
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,241
Rowley?

943
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:35,085
- What?
- Nothing.

944
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:54,491
You've been home for an hour
and haven't badgered me for any snacks.

945
00:55:54,572 --> 00:55:56,290
Are you feeling okay?

946
00:55:57,452 --> 00:56:01,001
Well, I'm kind of in a tough situation.

947
00:56:01,932 --> 00:56:03,445
I know something

948
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:06,490
and if I tell the truth about it,
it could hurt somebody.

949
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,530
But if I don't, it could hurt somebody else.

950
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:14,732
Well, you have to trust your gut
and try to do the right thing,

951
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:20,763
because it's our choices
that make us who we are.

952
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:24,327
Okay.

953
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:29,445
GREG: I was up all night,
tossing and turning,

954
00:56:29,532 --> 00:56:31,807
thinking about my mom 's advice.

955
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,725
And I finally decided to do the right thing.

956
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:38,566
I'm sorry I terrorized you, children.

957
00:56:39,252 --> 00:56:40,367
What?

958
00:56:41,092 --> 00:56:44,323
I decided to let Rowley
take one for the team.

959
00:56:47,412 --> 00:56:51,405
But I'm not entirely sure
that was the right call.

960
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:01,011
Hey, how's it going?

961
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:04,971
Well, I was pretty upset
about being suspended from Safety Patrol,

962
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:08,931
but then I just started drawing a bunch
of Zoo-wee Mamas and I felt better.

963
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:11,845
Look. I put you in this week's cartoon.

964
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,685
And you even get to say,
"Zoo-wee Mama."

965
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:17,686
Wow. That's really

966
00:57:20,492 --> 00:57:21,607
nice.

967
00:57:22,892 --> 00:57:24,644
So, listen.

968
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:28,088
It's kind of funny, you know,
the whole Safety Patrol thing.

969
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:29,241
Yeah?

970
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:31,610
Ready for the funny part?

971
00:57:31,692 --> 00:57:34,968
Well, I'm the one
who terrorized those kids!

972
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,364
- What?
- Yeah,

973
00:57:39,452 --> 00:57:42,171
and I think we can both learn
some valuable lessons from this.

974
00:57:42,252 --> 00:57:46,450
Like, I should be more careful what I do
in front of Mrs. Irvine's house.

975
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:48,488
And you, well,

976
00:57:49,572 --> 00:57:51,847
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to.

977
00:57:55,212 --> 00:57:58,568
You know what, Greg?
You're not a good friend.

978
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:03,000
Whoa. How could you even say that?
I'm a great friend.

979
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:06,129
If you were a great friend,
you would have told Mr. Winsky the truth.

980
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:08,806
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad about just...

981
00:58:08,892 --> 00:58:11,360
You only care about yourself.

982
00:58:11,692 --> 00:58:13,523
You hated my cartoon.

983
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:18,087
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.

984
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:21,608
You broke my hand
and you didn't even seem sorry.

985
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:24,286
That broken hand was the best thing
that ever happened to you!

986
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:27,530
Don't call me.

987
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:31,409
Don't come by my house. We're done.

988
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:50,763
I thought the whole thing would blow over.

989
00:58:50,852 --> 00:58:53,730
But Rowley was still giving me
the silent treatment.

990
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:56,884
- Even when I tried to make the first move.
- Yeah.

991
00:59:01,132 --> 00:59:04,681
ROWLEY: So, anyway, I was so angry
at him, I didn't know what to say.

992
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:10,010
MR. WINSKY: One of the kindergarteners
finally told their parents the whole story.

993
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:15,364
Greg? You're relieved of your Safety Patrol
duties, effective immediately.

994
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:17,851
Rowley,

995
00:59:19,012 --> 00:59:22,800
for showing dignity under false suspicion,
I am promoting you

996
00:59:23,652 --> 00:59:24,721
to team captain.

997
00:59:26,812 --> 00:59:31,124
Now, that's a position that I held
for two years. I know you'll honor it.

1003

Hey, Rowley, my mom says it's okay
for me to sleep over tonight.

1004
01:00:08,892 --> 01:00:10,166
Awesome!

1005
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:15,120
GREG: The whole thing with Rowley is,
I was willing to let bygones be bygones.

1006
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,646
But then he made friends with Collin
just to mess with me.

1007
01:00:17,732 --> 01:00:19,211
As if I even care if he...

1008

I will always have your back, Captain.

- Hey, Greg Heffley.

want to have a sleepover?

You wouldn't even have that game
if I hadn't told you about it.

- We need to move this along.

exactly what happened

Yeah. I ate it.

And you know what, people?
I just did you all a huge favor.

1309

I ate the cheese to show you all
how stupid this whole school is.

The wrong butt?

It's all meaningless.

1314
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:47,408
Just like this cheese.

You know what, Patty?

1333
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,804
One day middle school will end
and become high school.

1334
01:22:20,892 --> 01:22:23,281
And after that, it just becomes life.

1335

are important now won't be anymore.
